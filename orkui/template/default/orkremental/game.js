    "Beggar": "You showed up in jeans and a t-shirt. Someone hands you a loaner sword. You have no idea what 'lay on' means yet.",
    "Farmer": "You come out most weekends now and you've started learning where to stand so you don't get yelled at by the reeve.",
    "Fisherman": "You've sewn your own tunic and it mostly stays on. People stop calling you 'the new guy' for whole battles at a time.",
    "Miner": "You started building your own boffers in the garage. Half of them fail check, but the other half hit like trucks.",
    "Blacksmith": "Your weapons pass inspection every time now, and other people ask you to build for them. Duct tape is your love language.",
    "Merchant": "You've got the gate handled, the waiver binder is organized, and you can run a whole event day without losing your mind.",

    "Squire": "You carry the kingdom's water jugs and set up the canopy, but you're soaking up everything. The belted folk are watching.",
    "Footman": "You hold the line and don't die first anymore. You're not a hero yet, but the captain trusts you to anchor a flank.",
    "Veteran footman": "You've seen enough wars to read a charge before it happens. New fighters cluster behind you, and that's earned.",
    "Knight": "You earned your belt the hard way — on the field, fight after fight. People actually want you on their team now.",
    "Veteran knight": "You've worn the white belt long enough to teach it. Whole units pivot off your calls in the heat of a battle.",
    "Elite knight": "The Knight of Battle — knighted for mastery of the battlegame itself. You read scenarios, hold the bridge, and win wars lesser fighters can't even follow.",
    "Holy knight": "Master of the Battle ladder: a Battlemaster. You don't just win battlegames, you author them, and reeves trust your calls without a second glance.",
    "Legendary knight": "Kingdoms tell stories about you at fires. A title like yours comes around maybe once a generation, and everyone knows it.",

    "Student": "You're learning the magic classes — counting your verbals, memorizing your spell list, and dropping balls way too early.",
    "Apprentice mage": "You can actually heal someone mid-battle now without fumbling the words. The line stops yelling 'HEALER!' in vain.",
    "Mage": "You've taken up the Bard — songs and enchantments that buff your allies and lock down the enemy line. The whole team plays better when you're out there.",
    "Wizard": "You wield the Druid's craft now — control magic, entangles, and healing that turns the terrain itself into a weapon. Captains build battleplans around you.",
    "Master wizard": "The Wizard, pure and feared — death at range and a spell list dialed to the limit. One clean throw from you can break an entire push by itself.",
    "Chairman": "You're a Paragon now — the living example of your class, silver trim on your sash. New casters learn the craft at your side, and you set the standard on the field.",

    "Concentration": "Drilling the fundamentals over and over until the basics are second nature. You learn everything faster for it.",
    "Productivity": "You stop standing around between battles and actually use your reps. More gets done, more class progress earned.",
    "Bargaining": "You've learned how to talk a merchant down at the garb table and split a hotel room six ways. Everything costs less.",
    "Meditation": "You're the one who keeps the camp laughing and the fire stocked. Good morale spreads, and it makes everyone better.",

    "Strength": "Conditioning your body so your shots land hard and your shield arm holds all day. The fighting company pays the strong.",
    "Battle tactics": "Studying flanks, charges, and bridge holds until you can read a battle like a board game. Combat sense sharpens.",
    "Muscle memory": "Ten thousand reps until the cut throws itself. Your footwork and form improve without you even thinking about it.",

    "Mana control": "Drilling your verbals and spell economy until casting is clean and instant. The whole magic class comes easier.",
    "Immortality": "Stretching out your years on the field — stretching, hydrating, knowing when to sit a battle. The old guard endures.",
    "Time warping": "You've been doing this so long you see plays before they happen. The whole day seems to move at your pace now.",
    "Super immortality": "Some folks are still swinging at sixty like they're twenty. Become one of the legends who simply never leaves the field.",

    "Dark influence": "Forsake your knightly oaths and let darker forces guide your hand. Every art comes faster when you stop holding back.",
    "Evil control": "Learn to harness the corruption festering in you rather than be consumed by it, carrying more of it across each rebirth.",
    "Intimidation": "Cultivate a dread presence that makes merchants and rivals alike flinch and offer you whatever you ask, just to be rid of you.",
    "Demon training": "Forsake your knightly oaths and study the forbidden arts — raise the fallen and let dread do your fighting for you.",
    "Blood meditation": "Feed your power with rites best left unspoken. Each sacrifice swells the corruption within and makes you something darker.",
    "Demon's wealth": "Twist the spoils of every battle through unholy means, conjuring coin from suffering and the harvested souls of the slain.",

    "Homeless": "You don't own a stitch of garb. You borrow everything and pray it passes check. There is nowhere to go but up.",
    "Tent": "A pile of loaner gear from the kingdom box. It smells like a thousand other fighters, but it keeps you on the field.",
    "Wooden hut": "A basic tabard you threw together yourself. Plain, a little crooked, but unmistakably YOURS for the first time.",
    "Cottage": "A solid, decent kit that actually fits. Nothing fancy, but you look like you belong out there now.",
    "House": "A full kit — coordinated garb, working belt favors, the whole look. People can tell which kingdom you ride for at a glance.",
    "Large house": "Fine garb backed by real armor. You look sharp and you hit hard, and the photos from war weekend come out great.",
    "Small palace": "A noble's wardrobe — tailored garb, layered pieces, the kind of kit that turns heads across the entire field.",
    "Grand palace": "Royal regalia fit for a crown. Hand-tooled leather, trimmed in metal, the sort of getup bards describe for years.",

    "Book": "The rulebook. Reading it cover to cover means you finally stop arguing about whether that shot was good.",
    "Dumbbells": "A practice pell in your backyard. Hit it ten thousand times and your shots start landing on their own.",
    "Personal squire": "A helpful squire who hauls your gear and fetches your water, freeing you up to actually fight and teach.",
    "Steel longsword": "A quality boffer that's perfectly balanced and passes check every time. A good blade makes every fight cleaner.",
    "Butler": "A camp crew that keeps your site set up, your cooler stocked, and your day stress-free. Happy fighters fight better.",
    "Sapphire charm": "A full bag of spell components — balls, rings, and ribbons, all sorted and ready. Casting magic gets a whole lot easier.",
    "Study desk": "A proper crafting table for building boffers and garb. With real tools, you learn and improve far faster.",
    "Library": "The archives — every old rulebook, scroll, and kingdom history in one place. Knowledge of the game flows freely here.",
